# riscv-freertos

This project is an implementation of a [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) version for the RISC-V processor design that can be found at the [riscv-vhdl](https://github.com/Samulix20/riscv-vhdl) repository.

The code contains an example program that can be compiled using the [RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain 12.2](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain).
